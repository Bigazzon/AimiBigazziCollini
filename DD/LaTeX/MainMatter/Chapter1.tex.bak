This document is the Design Document (DD) of a mobile application called Travlendar+. It is mainly addressed to the software development team and its purpose is to provide an overall view of the architecture of the new system. The document defines: 
\begin{itemize}
\item	High level architecture;
\item	Used design patterns;
\item	Main components of the system;
\item	Runtime behavior.
\end{itemize}

\section{Description of the given problem}
Travlendar+ is a mobile, calendar-based application that helps the user to manage his appointments and to a greater extent set up the trip to his destination, choosing the best means of transport depending on his needs. \\
Travlendar+ will choose the most suitable way to get the user to his destination between a large pool of options, considering public transportation, personal vehicles, locating cars or bikes of sharing services and walking to the destination. It will take account of weather, traffic, possible passengers if any, the user-set break times and the potential will to minimize the carbon footprint of the trip, always focusing on taking him on time to his scheduled appointments. \\
Eventually the user will be able to purchase the tickets he will use to reach his destination in-app. The great customizability is one of the main strengths of Travlendar+, being able to fully comply with the user needs.

\section{Document Structure}
The paper is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item	Chapter 1: Introduction to the document, including some information
about its composition and the description of the problem;
\item	Chapter 2: This chapter shows the main components of the system and the relationships between them. It also explains the main architectural styles and patterns adopted in the design of the system;
\item	Chapter 3: This chapter explains how the system will work using algorithms. Java code is used to write down the most significant algorithms for the application;
\item	Chapter 4: This chapter shows mockups of the application and more details about the User Interface using UX and BCE diagrams;
\item	Chapter 5: This chapter explains how the decisions taken in the RASD are associater to design decisions;
\item	Chapter 6: This chapter describes the order of implementation of the subcomponents of the system and the order in which integrate
such subcomponents and test the integration;
\item	Chapter 7: Effort spent by the authors to draw up the document.
